1. Introduction
    a. What is your application?
It's a sudoku solver. It should take from "Input.txt" file sudoku puzzle and give a solution (if it is possible) in "Output.txt" file.
    b. How to run the program?
Eather run .exe application or in cmd write ".\main.py"
    c. How to use the program?
Write a puzzle inside a "Input.txt" file then run the program. The solution should be in cmd terminal or "Output.txt" file.

2. Body/Analysis 
    a. Explain how the program covers (implements) functional requirements
4 OOP pillars:
Inheritance

Polymorphism
It is capable of Polymorthisim but doesn't implament it in current state.
Encapsulation

It has two design paterns:
Builder
Decorator

3. Results and summary
    a. See "results" functional requirements
I tried to implament website but that was to difficult.
Python creates "__pychache__" files, tried to stop it with ".gitignore" didn't work.
Tried to implament Singleton pattern, doesn't work with unittest.
    b. See "Conclusions" functional requirement
Learnt how to implament files with python.
Learnt how to do unittest.
Widened my understanding of OOP and how to solve sudoku in computer terms.
    c. How it would be possible to extend your application?
It could be intigrated with a website. It could also be changed so that it can solve diffrent types of sudoku puzzles.
